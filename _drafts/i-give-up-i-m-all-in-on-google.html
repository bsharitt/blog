<p>For years I've had a back and forth relationship with Google, particularly over how much of my info they had and how much more they wanted. I was never comfortable with this "stranger" knowing so much about me.  So I'd run my mail with someone else, like Microsoft, Fastmail, or even self hosted(and sometimes hiding under Google's on nose in an separate Google Apps account). I'd use Dropbox for my file storage instead of Google Drive and their pretty good integration with Office Online instead of Google Docs. And probably the biggest trade off was switching to iOS for my phone and tablet. I still used Google, but it was mostly just for search and YouTube. I had cut up my data and spread it among many different companies, nobody had the full picture of me and that worked for a while.</p>

<p>The erosion of those walls came from what I would have once considered a very unlikely place, digital assistants. When Siri came out on the iPhone, it was neat toy, but I certainly didn't find it world changing, or even all that useful. My phone could tell me the weather with having to open an app, neat.  Google Now and later Google Assistant were also neat, and probably more useful than Siri, but they needed me to tear down those walls even more </p>
