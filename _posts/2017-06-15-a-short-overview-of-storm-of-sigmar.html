<p>As part of my recent catching up on painting, I've finished painting all the guys in my Storm of Sigmar box set that I got a while back. First of all the models in the box are all the same ones sold on the "Easy to Build" boxes. Those boxes are $15 a piece individually, but all 4 sets are in here for $33, so it's a pretty good deal for the models. Being the the easy to build variety, there's really no customization for building. You're going to cut everything off the sprue an they're going to basically fit together one way. That being said, all the models in the box are unique and their default poses are very nice and dynamic. For those new to wargaming, or at least the hobby side, this is a very easy set to pick up. They're easy to assemble and pretty easy and fun to paint.Â  The Khorne guys have a few more details to paint, but if you start with the Stormcast they are super simple and you can easily dial the details up or down and they'll still look pretty good.</p>
<p>Also in the box is a set of dice, some warscroll cards, and a rule book that not only has the rules and some scenarios, but also has a ruler on the back. So other than the hobby supplied to build and paint your models, it has everything you need to actually play the game in the box which is very nice for beginners. As far as the game goes, the scenarios are actually pretty varied and work as sort of an escalation so you can slowly work your way into the game and get comfortable with the mechanics. While the scenarios are good, there's not a ton or replayability, but for $33 the box does work a nice low barrier entry for Age of Sigmar. The recent release of Age of Sigmar: Skirmish may even make this an even better starter. Once you've mastered the scenarios in the box, you can pick up the cheap Skirmish rules($10 paper, $7.99 digital) and a hero for each side and jump into small scale skirmish slowly build up your armies.</p>
<p>For new wargamers, or those new to Age of Sigmar, I'd say this box is a very low risk way to dip your toes into the water, especially with the Skirmish and next step add on. If you find you don't like it, you'll only be out $33 instead of $125 for the full starter(though the new upcoming start at $80 might be tempting). Even if you decide not to fully get into miniature wargaming, the box is closer to a typical board game box that a typical GW model box with the top lifting off and all the models fit back into the box when assembled. That combined with everything you need to play also being in the box means that you can still keep it around and essentially a board game.</p>
