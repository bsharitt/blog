<p>I keep saying I'd like to try to make video games, but since you have to walk before you can run, I always get bored and stop when trying to make some sort of simple games as a stepping stone to the games I actually want to make. I think I've found a way to motivate me to make the simple game I usually don't care about and make a pretty cool gift for my daughter.</p>
<p>My plan is to make a Mario-like 2D platformer that features her as the star. I'm using <a href="http://www.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> as the engine and that seems to be working out pretty well. It seems powerful and scriptable enough to let me do what I need to do while at the same time still doing enough of the heavy lifting so I can spend most of my time on the art, sound, and level design. I haven't quite decided what direction I'm going with those yet. While it will be a fully 2D game(instead of 3D characters moving across the screen in a 2D fashion like some of the newer Mario games), I don't know if I want to go with or retro 8/16-bit retro look that's popular on even new platformers these days, or just go with a nice, yet simple modern style. At least I've got a couple of weeks before the art work becomes a more pressing issue while I get to know the engine a little better.</p>
<p>I'll be posting updates and perhaps even milestone builds of the game here for anyone that wants to follow along.</p>
