<p>I was really hoping to get some solid Go coding experience under my belt with a new project I'd been working on, but it's closely tied to some other projects I've done that are all in Python and I kept running into instances where I'd have to redo a lot of work I'd already done. But at the end of the day I decided that the experience would be worth it and persevered in Go. As luck would have it, as soon as I made that decision, a bunch of other suddenly needed doing, so I guess I'll go back to Python. Maybe next time.&nbsp;</p>
