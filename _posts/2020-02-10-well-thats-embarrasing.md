I wouldn't think doing anything at work without any proper version control, but apparently that's not the same at home. I've 
been working on this new blog for a couple of weeks now and I hadn't been committing to git. I'll get around to it, I thought. 
Well, I was moving some stuff around and cleaned up an extra copy of my repo, except it wasn't the extra copy. I had gotten so 
enamoured with VSCode's ssh remote extention, that I skipped what whould have been my normal git based work flow and just worked 
on the server's working copy. And the final compounding of the error is that the previous copy of my blog was in a location not 
being backed up. But now it's back and configured in its new home, in git, and even some fancy autodeploy stuff.
