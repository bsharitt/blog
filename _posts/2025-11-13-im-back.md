I've revived my old Jekyll based blog. I probably should start fresh, but for now I'm pulling out my old files out of GitHub and I think I'll just continue from here. That being said, there's been some big updates since the last time I posted. First of all, I go by Bridget now. I'm a trans woman and have been since about mid 2023. I have not idea what the content on here will look like going foward.
