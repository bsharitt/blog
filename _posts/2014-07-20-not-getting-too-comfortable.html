title: Not Getting Too Comfortable

<p>While I like my job and don't have any reason to leave it anytime soon, there is a bit of a problem. I'm just a bit too comfortable where I'm at. I get to play with a lot of neat things(despite the issues faced, vSMP is really a cool bit of technology), but they're in a rather narrow subset(HPC and supporting technology in my case). Of course it's not a problem unique to me, lots of people comfortable in their little narrow subsets of technology they use at work. I've not touched a Windows server in years and barely know PowerShell. I'm just now hearing about docker. I've even been missing out on things like Chef and Puppet because I don't use them at work(and now I'm kicking myself because maybe they could have).
<div></div>
<div>Luckily this realization comes not long after I've returned to having a real desktop computer. So I'm putting that spare CPU and RAM capacity(though I could really use about twice as much RAM) to good use with VMs(and even docker in some cases) to get myself acquainted with the latest shiny things in computing. Luckily I'm a student with Dreamspark Premium access, so I've even got Windows Server 2012 up and running. I'll be done "learning" Java for school within the next few weeks and once that's done it'll probably be PowerShell. Already messing with docker and getting acquainted with it. In addition to Windows 2012, I've also got CentOS 7 and Solaris 11 up and running(okay, not actually running right now, but all I have to do is issue the start command). So I've got a lot of catching up to do over the next few months and just have to make sure I don't let myself get so rusty on everything non-Linux next time.</div>
