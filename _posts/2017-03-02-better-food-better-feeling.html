<p>It's been over a week of no alcohol, no coffee, and a healthier more plant based diet. The first noticeable effect, that I'm assuming is due to the lack of caffeine and alcohol, is that I'm sleeping better than I have in a long time. The better sleep combined with eating less junk has led to feeling more energetic not feeling so lethargic though out the day. I'm actually surprised at the lack of rebellion by body with these pretty big changes. &nbsp;Maybe now that I don't necessarily need to shut down when I get him, I'll finally be able to make room for side projects.&nbsp;</p>
