<p>Switched my unread and rarely updated blog over to Wordpress. Google seems to have forgotten about Blogger and I expect it to find itself on the receiving end of a Google GTFO message in the next year or so to join the ranks of Google Reader and others. I'm not a fan of switching to PHP software, but there don't seem to be many good open source blogging platforms. &nbsp;The only other "big" option seems to Ghost, and I'll take PHP over nodejs nonsense any day.&nbsp;</p>
