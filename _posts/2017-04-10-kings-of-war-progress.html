<p>I've made a small amount of progress on my Kings of War army. Got a regiment of sheild breakers painted and put on a mutlibase and got my earth elemental painted. He's my second try of his kind since I wasn't aware that you can't spray prime the Reaper plastics and the first version ended up sticky. So I had to paint him the hard way. I'm still not very good at painting, but at least it's a step up from grey plastic or black primed army.</p>
